        text: <div>"I was struggling a lot with algebra in school and Michael was able to teach me in a way that helped me finally understand the concepts that I couldn't figure out for so long. Michael took the time to go through each step with me until I knew how to do it on my own.

        One of the things that stuck most with me is when we were doing ellipses and Michael compared them to the Whispering Gallery in Chicago. The connection between the two helped me deepen my understanding of ellipses and helped my brain conceptualize a topic that was once impossible for me to understand."</div>,

        text: <div>"Michael tutored me during my senior year for AP Physics and AP Calculus. I had never been tutored before; in fact, I was an NHS (National Honors Society) tutor at my school! We began working together in physics before the school year started, as I was worried on how I would balance my fall sports and college application process with all my rigorous classes. His help proved to be beneficial when I was one of only two students who got a 100 on our first test!
        <br/><br/>
        Michael would plan each session according to what I needed clarification on that week, whether it was a certain question, a certain class, or even a refresher in both classes. We always worked to get ahead in my classes, which allowed me to anticipate difficult topics, better plan my time, and ultimately minimize stress.
        <br/><br/>
        Michael is amazing at accommodating for students and is a great communicator! He was more than willing to answer any questions that came up during the week. Although I only took him up on this offer a few times, his assistance truly saved me when I was stressed about a problem (especially if it was the night before a test)! I am so thankful to Michael as he helped me through my senior year, improved my grades, and minimized my stress!"</div>,

        text: <div>"I was tutored by Mr. Michael Kazenel between 2018 - 2020 in a variety of AP science and math disciplines. During my time learning with Mr. Kazenel, I was exposed to a wider variety of problems than were covered in my classes. Everything I learned from each tutoring session helped me perform better on exams and homework assignments in my classes. Not only does Mr. Kazenel possess the ability to solve a wide range of STEM problems, he also has the ability to explain how we approached the answer to each problem. He gave me multiple opportunities to try and solve sample problems on my own, which I appreciated a lot because it helped me better understand the concepts I was learning.
        <br/><br/>
        Mr. Kazenel's tutoring sessions were also encouraging because he puts so much passion and enthusiasm in his work to help you understand a concept. When I didn't understand a concept right away, Mr. Kazenel would strive to use different methods to explain something without negative criticism. The detailed explanations and processes Mr. Kazenel provides throughout his tutoring are priceless and were 1000% worth my time."</div>,

        text: <div>"We hired Michael to tutor my son with middle school math.   The COVID pandemic combined with an unmotivated student and busy working parents created an extremely difficult situation.  Michael connected immediately with my son by comparing math problems to hockey, basketball, and other sports.  I was particularly impressed with Michael's ability to hold my son accountable for communicating  with his teachers about subject matters and assignments. This was something I could not do!  
        <br/><br/>
        Michael greatly improved my son's confidence in math, basic algebraic skills, and test scores.   Michael greatly reduced my stress level because I knew my son was learning and improving every week. This was proven during the second half of the year when I received an email from the math teacher complimenting my son on his continuous improvement throughout the year.   Michael is a true professional who has a gift for teaching.  Michael makes math easy!"</div>,

        text: <div>"Michael Kazenel is the ideal math and physics tutor! He helped both of our children throughout high school math classes, from honors geometry to AP calculus, and he also tutored one of our children in physics. Michael even continued to provide help at the college level.  It was always apparent how much Michael enjoyed sharing his understanding of a subject with students. Michael was very knowledgeable about the high school curriculum requirements, and he also truly wanted to ensure that each student had a strong overall understanding of key topics. Michael was patient and encouraging, and provided strong examples and sample problems.
        <br/><br/>
        Michael encouraged our children to reach out between tutoring sessions if they needed help, and tailored each session to the topics they were currently learning in the classroom. Our teens found it very valuable to work through each step of complex problems with such a knowledgeable educator. We have recommended Michael's teaching style and commitment to friends and acquaintences with great enthusiasm and confidence!"</div>,

Algebra, precalc, as well as statistics and calculus were all things Michael was able to assist me in. Michael never made me feel stupid for not understanding something, but always made me put in the work to actually learn something instead of just copying his work.
        <br/><br/>
        Michael also helped me with chemistry and physics. Regardless of the subject, Michael's teaching method was always one of organization, practice, and patience. On a scale of 1 to 10, I rate Michael an 11!"</div>,

        text: <div>"I am currently a Sophomore at university studying biomedical engineering. I was tutored by Michael Kazenel from my junior year of high school to my freshman year of college working on topics like physics and calculus. I am very grateful for the time I spent with Michael over the past couple of years because of how much of a difference it made in my difficult classes.
        <br/><br/>
        Michael would really dedicate his time to helping me understand the material and was very concise with his teaching. Additionally, Michael was very accessible and would help me even when we didn't have a tutoring lesson. With this, I was able to succeed in my most challenging classes and apply what I've learned in solving complex problems."</div>,

        text: <div>"I highly recommend working with Michael to improve Math SAT test scores and math skills in general. I worked with Michael to improve my SAT math score.   After our sessions, my Math SAT score went up by around 100 points.
        <br/><br/>
        Michael was very responsive to my needs.  He provided workbooks and made multiple customized binders with Math SAT practice problems. Michael is a very caring and invested tutor who was available to answer questions and look over my work outside of our sessions.  Typically, I would work on a Math SAT practice test during the week and would highlight questions I got stuck on.  During our session, we would go over these problems.  
        <br/><br/>
        One aspect of his tutoring style that I really appreciated was his focus on a deeper understanding of math concepts. While the Math SAT is typically thought of as a memorization test, I found it very helpful when we would go over the “why” or “how” of a question.  Building a more concrete foundation of my math knowledge helped me to recognize certain kinds of problems and visualize what the problem was asking me to solve. I have found myself using a lot of what I have learned  in my college calculus class.  Michael's passion has certainly made me a more curious and engaged math student."</div>,
